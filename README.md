TI 58/58C/59 like calculator

[This is my 1981's calculator](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/30_anni_casasoft/texasti58c.php).

Same years later I got a Commodore 64 and I tried to write an emaulator, 
but my knowledge was too limited and the available languages too elementary for the dream to become reality

Near 40 years later this project is here...
